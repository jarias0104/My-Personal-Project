      <h2>My Software Development Journey</h2>
        <p>It all started when I moved to canada to start my process as a Software Developer.
          <br> taking courses on Web Development, Programming Fundamentals, Arduino, Back-end Developing and Object Oriented Programming</p>
        <p>Being in college represented few problems like adapting to a fast advancing rhythm with my teachers and also having to learn a lot of concepts by myself and adapting to life in Canada.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Programming Languages <br> I have worked with:</h2>
        <p>By far I have worked with a variety programming languages confronting issues and adapting to different forms of syntax and language behaviors.</p>
